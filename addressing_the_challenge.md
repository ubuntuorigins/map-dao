# Addressing the Challenge

Our proposal fit the campaign by providing a tool that can help map locations businesses in the informal sector in Africa and the world at large. This would provide a platform that would leverage on Cardano blockchain to integrate business communities and build a global network of mappers. 

Also, ADA would be used to distribute reward to network of mappers. Business owners would equally integrate voluntarily ADA as part of the crypto adopted for its business and the team provide education and facilitate crypto use within the informal business space. 

The map DAO would be open for other communities to use and develop crypto use map at various localities even though the team behind the proposal would focus on informal businesses in Ghana and Africa. 

> The focus on the informal sector does not exclude formal businesses that use crypto.
